# Guidelines

## TODO:
1. explain shortly how mkdocs works 
2. Creating a new content page needs a folder (ex `Medical`, `Contributing`, etc)
3. The first `# text` line will be the name of the page, so the the actual file can be named whatever, but in the wiki it will be named based on the title (the first `# whatever`)
