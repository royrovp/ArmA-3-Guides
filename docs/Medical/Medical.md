# Basic ACE Medical
This guide is aimed primarily towards players who have not used ACE Medical previously, but also covers more general topics that helps anyone become a more effective part of the squad.

## ACE Medical fundamentals

ACE Medical is part of the ACE mod, which aims to increase the realism of ArmA 3 Gameplay. ACE Medical therefore extends the vanilla ArmA 3 health model and adds several additional factors, such as different types of wounds, bleeding, heart rate, blood pressure, and so on. On top of this there are also an extended arsenal of treatments available to the player, and knowing which one to choose in what circumstances is part of the fun.

Lets begin.

### Taking Damage with ACE Medical
  In vanilla ArmA 3, damage dealt to a unit is treated mostly as a simple decrease to that units HP. On top of this there may be other effects such as broken limbs and decreased accuracy.

  ACE Medical adds an intermediat stage with the simulations of wounds.

  With ACE Medical, damage will cause the unit to suffer wounds of different types depending on the types of damage. The wounds can in turn have different effects such as bleeding and pain, which affect the players accuracy, vision, stamina, and so on.

  **Dealing with wounds and their knockon effects is the main gameloop of ACE Medical**

### Unit states

### Simulated Parameters
Knowing what ACE simulates will help you know what to care about when the bullets start flying. No reason to treat trenchfoot and dehydration when you could instead be returning fire.

#### Wounds
  ACE Medical uses the type of damage received to determine what categories of wounds to apply. There are quite a few types of wounds with different characteristics, but in an effort to make this guide as simple as possible we will not list them here.
  
  All you need to know is this:

  **Start with whatever limb is bleeding the most**
  
  How to determine which limb that is will be covered in the setion on the ACE Medical Menu.


#### Bleeding
  Bleeding is caused by open wounds. The player starts with 6 Liters of blood. Blood does not regenerate on its own, but can be given by using an IV bag of Blood, Plasma, or Saline. There is no difference between the types of IV liquid in terms of gameplay or effect. FACTCHECK THIS.

#### Vitals
  ACE Medical simulates the heart by means of two vital values. Heartrate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Almost all types of damage will eventually cause these values to divert from their nominal values. As such they are a good way to meassure how a unit is doing.
#### Pain
#### Fractures
