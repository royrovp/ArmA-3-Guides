While HTML tags are permitted in Markdown, I highly recommend using markdown syntax over html where possible. For example:  </p> <ul> <li>use double spaces at the end of the line to create a new line, instead of using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code></li> <li>use double asterix for bold text instead of <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> </li> </ul> <p>Here is a cheatsheet of all things you can write using  Markdown check this link </p>"},{"location":"Contributing/Guidelines/#mkdocs","title":"Mkdocs","text":"<p>Mkdocs is a static site generator which takes our markdown files and plugins as declared in <code>mkdocs.yml</code> and generate a full webpage.

When damage is taken ACE determines the types, sizes, and ammounts of wounds to apply to the player based on the type of damage. For now all you really need to know is that some wounds are bigger than other, and therefore will require more urgent attention. If you are hit in the arm with a .50 cal you might want to take care of that much sooner than if you take a 9mm to your chestplate. </p>"},{"location":"Medical/Basic_Medical/#secondary-effects","title":"Secondary Effects","text":"<p>Wounds in turn will cause seconday effects on the player.</p> <p>This is where the health model comes into play. While vanilla ArmA 3 models health closer to a common HP system where a single number represents the health of the unit, ACE instead models parameters such as heartrate, bloodpressure, and pain. These are all interlinked with eachother and in turn affect the overall state of the players health, such as unconciosness, stamina, accuracy, and even vision.</p> <p>These seconday and tertiary effects are the result of taking damage, and the goal of the ACE Medical gameplay loop is to revert these effects and \"Heal\" the unit.</p>"},{"location":"Medical/Basic_Medical/#treatments","title":"Treatments","text":"<p>Treatments in vanilla ArmA 3 is mostly a one-and-done thing, what with FAKs and Medkits. In ACE Medical this is much, much more neuanced and the core gameplay of the system.</p> <p>Each wound and effect are best treated by a specific treatment option, and more often than not the treatments come with both pros and cons, so choosing the correct one can make a huge difference. For non-medics however there is room for some amount of generalisation to make it easier.</p> <p>Treatments can be broken down into three categories  </p> <ul> <li>Bandages</li> <li>Medications</li> <li>Specialized</li> </ul> <p>Bandages are the most straight forward. You apply a bandage to a wound to stop it from bleeding. There are however several different types of bandages to choose from but we will cover which you need to care about later.</p> <p>Medications are a little bit more tricky. This category mainly refers to <code>Morphine</code> and <code>Epinephrine</code>. These affect not the wounds but rather target the secondary effects by altering the vital parameters. We will cover how to use them and what to be carefull of later, but for now just remember that you want to be carefull with these.</p> <p>The Specialized category include items such as <code>Tourniqets</code>, <code>Splints</code>, and <code>IVs</code>. These items are designed to do a single task, and are pretty straight forward. We will discuss the workings of these later as well. There are more specialized items available, but as a non medic these three are the ones you need to care about.</p>"},{"location":"Medical/Basic_Medical/#interacting-with-ace-medical","title":"Interacting with ACE Medical","text":"<p>How to interact with ACE Medical as a
